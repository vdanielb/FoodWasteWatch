    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <p> <br><b>What have you done so far? </b><br>

    <br> So far, we've created the main visualization for the project, which is a map that displays how much waste is generated across different states in the USA. We have hover and tooltips implemented in our map, but we intend to add more interactive features such as being able to click on a specific state to view the breakdown of waste based on sector. <br>
    
    <br> We've also set up a GitHub repository and deployed the webpage, so it's already accessible online. In addition, we plan to create a second visualization to complement the map, which takes a scrollytelling format, to put into perspective how much waste each person, household, city, etc is generating, on average. <br>
    
    <br><b> What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why? </b><br>
    
    <br> The most challenging aspect will likely be designing and implementing the animations for the scrollytelling section, which requires good technical execution and also creativity in how we present the data in a meaningful and relatable way. We need to create a compelling narrative that clearly communicates the main insights while still being easy to understand. Then, we aim to add more interactive elements to keep the webpage engaging and informative for users. <br> 
    
    <br> Lastly, it will also be a challenge to improve the performance of our visualization to make it more seamless. <br></p>
